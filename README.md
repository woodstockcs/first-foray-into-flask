1. Watch from 00:00:00 to 00:47:00 of [this cs50 lecture](https://video.cs50.net/2018/fall/lectures/7). That covers the sections "Introduction" through "froshims0" (inclusive).
2. In your cs50 ide, `cd ~` then `mkdir chapter7`.
2. Then `cd` into your chapter7 directory.
3. Type out yourself the full `froshims0` application (multiple files) from the lecture. (Actually typing it yourself, instead of copy/pasting it, is important and helps you build muscle memory!)
4. Run the program to make sure it works. Debug as needed, referencing back to the lecture or classmates for support.
5. Adapt the program at least a small amount, so that it's not about Frosh IM's, but it's about something else (you decide what).
6. Take screenshots of your updated code, and paste them into the questions doc for this assignment in google classroom.
